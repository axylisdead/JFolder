I found this on a weird Chinese forum from 2004, it was broken as fuck and all in Chinese so I translated it to English and fixed it
You can convert it to a JAR or a WAR if you want

It's basically a webshell with options for file browsing, uploading, deleting, editing, downloading for Java based web applications

It was originally written by a guy called Stephen Cee, but it was translated and fixed by me
Enjoy
